  Bubuloo Kids Learning Games
</h1>

Hi! My name is Olena. I’m an indie developer and illustrator passionate about building calm, ad-free digital spaces for kids.

Bubuloo is my ongoing collection of handcrafted educational apps for toddlers and preschoolers — designed to turn screen time into something gentle, playful, and meaningful.

Each game is built with care to encourage creativity, focus, and a sense of discovery — all in a safe digital space that parents can feel good about.
