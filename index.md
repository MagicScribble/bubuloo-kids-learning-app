# 🎨 Bubuloo Kids Learning Games

Hi! I’m an indie developer and illustrator passionate about building calm, ad-free digital spaces for kids.

I create kids educational applications with one goal: to give toddlers and preschoolers a safe, creative screen-time experience — one that parents can feel good about.

Bubuloo is a growing collection of educational games designed for toddlers and preschoolers — focused on safe, creative, and meaningful screen time.

Whether it’s exploring sounds, practicing memory, or learning new words — each Bubuloo game is crafted with care to spark imagination and gentle discovery.
